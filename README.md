# MiniOPL3

FM synthesizer with OPL3

## Description

This program is a music synthesizer based on emulation of one or more OPL3 chips.

This simplified instrument is mono-timbral, it supports one channel of MIDI playback.

It can be more adequate for devices which do not use a GUI editor (for example the Zynthian).
Instead, the chip registers are manipulated as parameters, and they can be collected to form independent presets.

Inside the tools directory, a program `bank2preset` is provided for converting WOPL banks to LV2 presets.
By default, just a small subset of banks is provided, because the documents can be quite heavy and slow down LV2 loading.

This is how to obtain more banks:
- create or convert some using the tool [OPL3 Bank Editor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor);
- get some from an [existing collection](https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug-embedded-banks/tree/master/opl3).

## Generating a preset bundle

A preset bundle in LV2 format is a directory of suffix `.lv2` containing 2 files.
- `manifests.ttl`, generated by option `-M <prefx>`
- `presets.ttl`, generated by option `-L <prefx>`

The bundle will be designated by a URI prefix of your choice, which you should terminate with the character `#`.

**Usage example:**

```
mkdir my-presets.lv2
bank2preset -M "http://example.com/my-presets#" my-presets.wopl > my-presets.lv2/manifest.ttl
bank2preset -L "http://example.com/my-presets#" my-presets.wopl > my-presets.lv2/presets.ttl
```
